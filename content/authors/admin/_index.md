#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

# ## About Me

# I am an AI researcher specializing in evolving data stream learning, focusing on advanced techniques like Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting. My work addresses critical challenges in Online Learning, including detecting and adapting to concept drifts in data streams and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in Neural Networks for online learning. I actively contribute to the open-source MOA and CapyMOA stream learning frameworks. I have also published multiple publications in reputed venues and have delivered tutorials on online learning. I bring a wealth of industry experience in participating in multiple machine learning projects and developing network capture tools. Explore my GitHub for accessible source codes.
